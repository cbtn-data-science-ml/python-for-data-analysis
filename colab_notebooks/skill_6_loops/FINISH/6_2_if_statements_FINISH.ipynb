For example, `if` is the first conditional expression, and if you need more, use `elif`. When you use `if` and `elif`, the last expression is normally `else.` `else` is an expression that runs when `if` and `elif` have run or were skipped. So it makes sense that it is used as the last expression. \n","\n","You can use as many `elif` expressions as you need but remember not to repeat yourself.
