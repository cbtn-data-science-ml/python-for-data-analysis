In this course, we will cover two of them—Lists and Dictionaries:\n","\n","- `List` - a collection ordered, changeable, and duplicate values\n","- `Set` - a collection which is both unordered and unindexed\n","- `Dictionary` - a collection of ordered\\*, changeable, and unique key-value pairs\n","  > As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.\n","- `Tuple` - a collection of unordered, unchangeable, and unique values\n","\n","A [list](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-list) is much like an [array](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/array)—if you don't know these terms mean, click on each word to learn more."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1-xQKqDqW8Nh"},"source":["## Lists\n","Lists are mutable data structures that hold an ordered collections of items. That was a mouthful, so let's break it down, step by step. Mutable means you can make changes to the list by adding or removing items from the list. Ordered means, they stay in order but not the same as sorted. Note that the terms collections, lists and arrays are somewhat interchangeable within the scope of computer science."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"KWcYnHpQXY-8"},"source":["my_list = [\"one\",\"two\",\"three\"]\n","print(my_list)\n","\n","type(my_list) # what data type is this"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pOoQ1LWLW_Gi"},"source":["## Sets\n","Even though, you will not use Sets in this course, at least a high level overview is in order. Sets are written with curly braces, are unordered, immutable, and do not allow duplicates. Let's unpack each of these traits, one by one. Instead of `()` like as lists, sets use `{}` and are unordered. For example, like a box of chocolates; you never know what you will get. Immutable means that you cannot change any of the items after they have been created but you can add new items. Finally, sets do not allow two items with the same value—no duplicates allowed."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ER_UqgYlXv2U"},"source":["my_set = {\"one\",\"two\",\"three\"}\n","print(my_set)\n","type(my_set)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"C9EKDcKyW_K_"},"source":["## Dictionaries\n","What is a dictionary? Unlike lists which contain an ordered list, a dictionary is unordered. Instead, dictionaries create associations between two pieces of information, called a key and value pair. Much like a real, dictionary, the word is the key and the definition is the value. When you want to connect one data to another. For example, when you want to map a state and capital, then use a dictionary, not a list. In this case, the identifier, or key, is the state which is associated with the value, which is the capital. We can use dictionaries with inventory as well. For example, when the key is `\"Macbook Pro\"` and the value is the price of the product which is `1799`. To conclude, a dictionary is a collection of one or more `key:value` pairs.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"v9qXsEpFXwx9"},"source":["my_dict = {1:\"one\",2:\"two\",3:\"three\"}\n","print(my_dict)\n","type(my_dict)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"j3QkHP_nW_PS"},"source":["## Tuples\n","You will not use Tuples in this course, but here is a short summary.

That said, you can use Lists as Arrays; however, to really use Arrays in Python, you will need to import a library to do so. This why the Python community is so great—you can use Python as a general programming language or modify it for free to suit almost any special field, such as data anlytics. Simply downloading a library like [NumPy](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp) and you are ready to wrok with Arrays. You will not learn how to use NumPY in this course but you will do so in the next course, Pandas for Data Analysts."]}]}
