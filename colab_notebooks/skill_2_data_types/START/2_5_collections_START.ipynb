In this course, we'll cover two; lists and dictionaries:\n","\n","- `List` - a collection of ordered, changeable, and duplicate values\n","- `Set` - a collection that is both unordered and unindexed\n","- `Dictionary` - a collection of ordered\\*, changeable, and unique key-value pairs\n"," > As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.\n","- `Tuple` - a collection of unordered, unchangeable, and unique values\n","\n","A [list](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-list) is much like an [array](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/array)—if you don't know these terms mean, click on each word to learn more."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1-xQKqDqW8Nh"},"source":["## Lists\n","Lists are mutable data structures that hold ordered collections of items. That was a mouthful, so let's break it down, step by step. Mutable means you can change the list by adding or removing items from the list. Ordered means they stay in order which is not the same as a sorted list. Note that the terms collections, lists, and arrays are somewhat interchangeable within computer science."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"KWcYnHpQXY-8"},"source":["# what data type is this"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pOoQ1LWLW_Gi"},"source":["## Sets\n","Even though you will not use sets in this course, a high-level overview is in order. Sets are written with curly braces, are unordered, immutable, and do not allow duplicates. Let's unpack each of these traits, one by one. Instead of `[]` like as lists, sets use `{}` and are unordered. For example, like a box of chocolates, you never know what you will get. Immutable means that you cannot change any of the items after being created, but you can add new items. Finally, sets do not allow two items of the same value—no duplicates allowed."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ER_UqgYlXv2U"},"source":["# what data type is this"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"C9EKDcKyW_K_"},"source":["## Dictionaries\n","What is a dictionary? Unlike lists that contain an ordered list, a dictionary is unordered. Instead, dictionaries create associations between two pieces of information, called a key and value pair. Like a real dictionary, the word is the key, and the definition is the value. When you want to connect one data to another. For example, when you want to map a state and capital, use a dictionary, not a list. In this case, the identifier, or key, is the state associated with the value, which is the capital. We can use dictionaries with inventory as well. For example, when the key is `\"Macbook Pro\"` and the value is the product's price, which is `1999`. To conclude, a dictionary is a collection of one or more `key:value` pairs.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"v9qXsEpFXwx9"},"source":["# what data type is this"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"j3QkHP_nW_PS"},"source":["## Tuples\n","You will not use Tuples in this course, but here is a short summary.
