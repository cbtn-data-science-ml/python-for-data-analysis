That said, Python does reach a limit where you must either write your own custom functions or import a library. For example, the `sqrt()` function is not available in the base installation of Python, but you can import the `NumPy` or `Math` libraries when needed. Let that soak in. If you run into limitations in Python, chances are there's a library for that! :) \n","\n","## Square roots\n","However, you can still use the `**` operator to square a number without importing any package."],"metadata":{"id":"FCZMszSbmN_H"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# square the number 5 using the exponent operator\n"],"metadata":{"id":"z3i7RmslmNlb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Next, try to guess what the square root function might be.
