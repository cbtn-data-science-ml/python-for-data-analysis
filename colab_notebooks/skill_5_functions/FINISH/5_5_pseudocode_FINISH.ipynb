So why would you use pseudocode instead of actual code? \n","\n","Here's why. \n","\n","When you are learning Python, thinking about writing syntax and the logic of an application is much more complicated than focusing on one at a time. For example, why not figure out the logic of your app before you actually start writing Python code? That is precisely the benefit of using pseudocode‚Äîyou can figure out what you want the app before writing any code.
